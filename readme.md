groupVance
============
Application Overview
groupVance is a full-stack web application to track daily progress toward a personal goal.  Members join a group and log-in each day to report that they have prayed that day. The Member dashboard displays their team, and each group members progress toward the goal for the past week.  

Feature Overview
When logged in, users are able to log that they took a step towards their personal goal.  They can also view the performance of other members in their group for the past week.  Users can encourage other members in their group by either sending them a "High Five" or by "Lighting a Fire" under them.  Additionally, users are able to view these messages (called Shouts) from other members and then they are given the option to respond with a "Thank You" shout. (Each type of shout can only be sent to each recipient once per day from each sender.  Also, users cannot send a "Thank You" in response to a "Thank You" to prevent a never ending loop of thanks.)
